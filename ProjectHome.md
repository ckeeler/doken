Doken is developed by security specialists for security specialists with the goal to provide a rock solid tool to do a security penetration test over a DBMS system.

Doken will support a large number of DBMS, with ad hoc tests and with a pluggable architecture.

Doken's output will be a security report containing the list of detected vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker trying to break in a DBMS.
